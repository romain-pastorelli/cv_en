		<h1>Profil</h1>
		<p>I am a big fan of computer science, and science in general, I'm really curious and like to inform myself, acquire a lot of knowledge and develope new skills. I always learnt by myself so I am quite autonomous.
		    <br>
		    I can take initiatives when it is necessary, I can adapt easily and I learn fast. I can work in team as well as by myself.
		    <br>
		    I am also respectful, rigorous, efficient and nice to people.</p>

		    <p><strong>Penetration tester</strong>
			<br>
			<em>Hackuity, Lyon, France</em>
			<br>
			I worked in a 5 people Red team as a penetration tester. I led the team for two years, and had to face big stress situations where I had to take important decision in order to finish the mission. Moreover, as the job requires, I had to react as quick as possible in critical situations, when we were close to get caught.</p>

		    <p><strong>Mathematics personnal teacher</strong>
			<br>
			<em>Private home, Aix-les-Bains, France</em>
			<br>
			I gave weekly mathematics lessons to students, from the CM1 to the Première. It was mostly helping them doing their homework or review courses to prepare them for an test, but I also had the opportunity to make, for a child, a whole teaching program, scheduled for 2 months, including lessons, exercices, frequent little test and a final "exam". It helped me develop my pedagogy, my patience and my work organization.</p>
